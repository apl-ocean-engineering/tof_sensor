# tof_sensor
ROS package to produce TOF 3D color point clouds utilizing TI's [voxelsdk](https://github.com/3dtof/voxelsdk) package and an additional monocular camera. Can calculate the extrinsic paramaters of a depth sensor and a monocular camera, based on: D. Herrera C., J. Kannala and J. Heikkil√§, "Joint Depth and Color Camera Calibration with Distortion Correction," in IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, vol. 34, no. 10, pp. 2058-2064, Oct. 2012.   

Still a work in progress...

## Requirments
ROS (tested on Melodic)  
[voxelsdk](https://github.com/3dtof/voxelsdk)  
[Eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page)  
[OpenCv](https://opencv.org/)

## Installing
Clone into <catkin_ws>/src and compile using catkin_make in <catkin_ws> location.   

## Running
There are three main nodes in the package so far: 1) tof_pointcloud_publisher, which publishes pointcloud data via. ROS from a TOF sensor using TI's VoxelSDK package. 2) extrinsic_calibration, which will extrinsically calbirate a TOF-Visible light sensor. 3) pointcloud_image_fusion, which will fuse a calibrated pointcloud with associated RGB image. Not very user friendly yet.
